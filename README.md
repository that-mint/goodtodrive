Personal discord bot for my server, very lightweight and basically just for gags as well as to see how the discord.py library works.

Probably not scalable, checks every single message, so I don't recommend to be deployed on any big server.

Requires an SQL server currently, and the code doesn't work if you disable sql.

VERY CUSTOMIZABLE, a very very good base for a simple bot if needed.
